this is a front-end-based landing page made with React. Some other libraries are used such as React Icon for icons and swiper js for slider. Apart from that the whole no other library was used. The styling here is made with vanilla CSS. To use It in your local machine simply clone this repo and add run this code into your terminal

```npm i```

it will install all the necessary dependencies for the landing page to run in your system. I also added the live link here you can check it out from there also.
